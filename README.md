# EAC API

This serves ressources for the [EAC application](https://github.com/betagouv/eac).


## Installing

Depends on node (tested on v10).

run `npm install`


## Running

`npm start`

And open your browser at _http://localhost:3000/actors_ to find the default
list of actors.

It will require either a local MongoDB running or a environ variable `MONGO_URI`
pointing to a running instance.
